# Techblog

Techblog is an application currently in development phase. It's designed to test the communication between a WordPress backend using its REST API and an Android application utilizing Retrofit2 library. The Android application is written in Java.

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to explore and demonstrate the interaction between a mobile application and a WordPress-powered backend through RESTful API endpoints. By leveraging Retrofit2 library in the Android application, we aim to establish seamless data exchange, enabling functionalities such as fetching blog posts, submitting comments, user authentication, etc.

## Features

- **WordPress REST API Integration**: Utilizes WordPress REST API endpoints for fetching blog content, managing comments, and user authentication.
- **Retrofit2 Implementation**: Utilizes Retrofit2 library for handling HTTP requests and interactions with the WordPress backend.
- **Java-Based Android Application**: The Android application is written in Java, providing a robust and familiar development environment.
- **Building Progress**: The application is actively being developed, with features being implemented and tested incrementally.
